# Comparing-Two-Image-OpenCV


Opencv detect changes between two photos .Using this process, we were ready to easily determine if two images were like or had differences due to slight image manipulations, compression artifacts, or purposeful tampering. To know more about computing and visualizing image differences with Python and OpenCV.
